Please teach me how to update the style.css. I cant fix certain things that are wrong. 
Also Here is where you write notes for memory. 


__There is something in the style.css causing a space under the picture. 
__ style.css preventing me from adding space to sections. 
__ Find petter pictures for the 3 people
__ link all of the buttons to the appropriate page

__ Once home page is complete start making it responsive

__ Fix up Prayer request section.Outline is messed up. Make button like other buttons.Rename 
objects it breaks nav and other sections. It is supposed to be an anonomous section where people 
can send prayer request without having to put there and and can share the things that they 
are going through. It will be sent to one person in Main Committe.
