                        <b>We devote our lives to ensuring the expansion of the kingdom. We are willing to make the sacrifices
                        and do whatever it takes to get the job done. We each play a different role in this team that God has placed together. He has seen 
                        each of our drive, determination and willingness to serve him. We, as leaders, made the choice to represent him in everything that we 
                        do. Being an example for the future disciples that are soon to come. We are here to spread the message around our neighborhoods and 
                        make disciples out of the lost sheep. Each with our own specialties that come together in perfect harmony for the goodness of the lord.
                        Love is the message we always try to share because it is the solution to everything, and Jesus brought us that perfect example and we made 
                        the choice to apply it in our lives.
